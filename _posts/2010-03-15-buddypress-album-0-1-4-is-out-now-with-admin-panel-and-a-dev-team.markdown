Two great announcements:



	
  * Carl Roett (foxly in bp forums) joined me in the development of this plugin.

	
  * At last BP album+ 0.1.4 has an admin panel. If you used costants to config it you can now delete them and write your values in the backend.


In next days we will talk about the next features we are going to code and write down a roadmap. We may also ask your opinion about it, so you should follow future posts here ( you know what [RSS](http://flweb.it/feed) is, don't you?)
