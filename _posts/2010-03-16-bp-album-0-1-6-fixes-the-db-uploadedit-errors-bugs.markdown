Carl Roett did a great work last days with the bugfixes. The 0.1.6 version should resolve all bugs you reported, if not you should [report them in this forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/bp-album?forum_id=10) or join existing threads there. Please don't ask for support in this blog comments.

Right now we are working together to implement:



	
  * admin option to switch between "Facebook Style" and "Flickr Style" thumbnails

	
  * pics categorization

	
  * even more easy templating

	
  * widgets


I hopefully will have more time for coding next days, last days I studied a lot for an exam I have taken today.
