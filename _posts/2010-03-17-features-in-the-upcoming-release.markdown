Okay community, we've just finished our developer's meeting and have  decided what features we're going to include in the next BP Album+  release. They will be as follows:



	
  1. Multiple album capability based on image tags. We will be  mimicking Flickr's image tagging, sorting, and gallery functions. Users  will be able to tag their images, and create albums based on the tags  they apply.
There will be two classes of image tags: user tags, and admin tags.  User tags can be used for sorting and grouping images, admin tags can be  used by administrators to approve images for various purposes, as well  as for use by other plugins on the site. For example, on a dating site  that charges users to view or upload images, or a realty site that  charges realtors to post property photos.

	
  2. The ability to tag site members in photos, with the ability for  the photo owner to remove unwanted tags from their photo, and the  ability for a user that has been tagged in the photo by the owner to  remove themselves as well. The tagging system will tie into the @mention  system within BuddyPress. Support will be included for "bounding box"  tags on images as is done on Flickr (face tags on FaceBook), but the  function will not be activated in this release.

	
  3. Configurable thumbnail aspect ratios. There will be a setting in  the admin menu that allows the plugin to be switched between "Facebook  Style" AND "Flickr Style" thumbnail display.

	
  4. "Perfect" templates - all of the HTML will be generated IN the  template and be fully editable by the template developer. Image  rendering functions will accept size parameters. This will allow  template developers to dramatically alter the look of the plugin.


... That's it ...

We're targeting Monday next week for a beta release.

Get excited!
