As announced in the last post the beta version has been released today.

Please **use this version only on tests sites, we will not provide support for it**. The purpose of this version is to demonstrate the new features. We are doing major changes so you should wait a more stable version before reporting bugs. Probably db structure will change before next release.

You can always download latest development version from [http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/bp-album.zip](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/bp-album.zip)

New features:



	
  * keyword tagging and member tagging

	
  * multiple album dynamically generated, based on tags

	
  * disk based image caching with custom sizes
