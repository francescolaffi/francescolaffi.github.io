Those are not fresh news so you could already know it, I write them here for who don't and for leaving a bunch of useful links in a convenient place :)



	
  1. BuddyPress Album is being renamed to **BuddyPress Media** that better reflects the plugin scope and features. It's a work-in-progress so you'll probably see it called in both ways.

	
  2. the project is now hosted on Google Code: [BuddyPress Media on code.google.com](http://code.google.com/p/buddypress-media/).


If you are not interested in following BP Media development you can stop reading here, you only need to know that:

	
  * BP Media stable releases are still hosted on WP plugin repo so you'll be able to install/update from your WP backend as usual ([BP Media on wordpress.org/extend](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bp-album/)).

	
  * BP Media is still (and will always be) licensed under GPLv2.

	
  * General support is still handled on the [plugin group on bp.org](http://buddypress.org/community/groups/bp-moderation/forum/).


Instead if you are interested in BP Media development you'll be happy to know that this choice will improve **interaction with community **and it's **involvement in the project development**, in addition to ease collaboration between committers.

What you'll find on google code:
