I'm travelling Croatia by motorbike (BMW F650GS) with my girlfriend, she took with us her netbook to post on [her blog](http://girasoliallamattina.com) about the travel so why not post some info and photo here too? My site have been semi-dead for some time anyway, some fresh content will be nice.

We already did half of the trip but I'll start from the beginning and make sevaral posts, so they won't be real time and I'll still be writing them after the trip is finished.

You can read my girlfriend [posts on this trip in Croatia on her blog](http://girasoliallamattina.com/category/viaggi/croazia-2012/), in Italian.


## The Route


This is the route we planned (clockwise) and it is a good approximation of what we ended up doing, I'll probably do another precise map with suggested spots while I do posts for trip legs.

## Planning and Departure


This is our second long trip on two wheels (last summer we did 2800km on the alps) so we were confident about the bike, distances and luggage. We booked rooms/apartments beforehand on airbnb, booking and hostel sites, we also booked an hotel with a groupon, leaving only some holes to the end of the trip.

We started our journey on July 20, we planned a 20 days route. Travelling in two on only one bike we had to fit lot of things and we needed to use lateral luggage, rear luggage+bag and tank bag; bike is heavier and larger so it loses some agility, it's still an enjoyable ride, but it can be wearing on long distances.
