BP-Moderation 0.1.7 is out, and it's compatible with the two most recent BuddyPress minor versions.

The moderation admin interface has been moved in its own top level admin menu item, to address the removal of the BuddyPress menu item that was used as parent for BP-Mod item. No new features, just a maintenance release.

For issues and feature suggestion open a ticket at [https://github.com/francescolaffi/BP-Moderation/issues](https://github.com/francescolaffi/BP-Moderation/issues)

Next in the roadmap:
* test current version against wp 3.6
* work on the refactoring
