## WPday Bologna


![banner-wpday](/app/uploads/2013/08/banner-wpday.png) [WPday](http://www.wpday.it/) is an event for WordPress developer and designers that will take in Bologna on 13 Sept 2013. Is organized by [GrUSP](http://www.grusp.it/), the national PHP user group, and [pugBO](http://bologna.grusp.org/), the local one, which I am part of.

I'll be talking about [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/), a great command line tool for WordPress professionals and power users. Don't miss it!


## WordCamp Europe


I'll also be at [WordCamp Europe](http://2013.europe.wordcamp.org/) in Netherlands in October as a volunteer, this doesn't need an introduction, you just have to know it's the biggest and most awesome WordPress event in Europe. Hope to see you there!
