The first [WPday](http://www.wpday.it/) was a success, with a professional public it was possible to have a more technical track and interesting conversations during the breaks, thanks to everyone that took part to it for the great event! I hope you enjoyed it too!

As [pugBO](http://bologna.grusp.org) we were very satisfied with the result and we'll definitely organize other events beside our usual monthly meetings, follow us on [@pugBologna](https://twitter.com/pugbologna) or [fb.me/pugbo](http://fb.me/pugbo) to keep updated and join the conversation on [www.facebook.com/groups/pugbo/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pugbo/).


### wp-cli: WordPress Command Line Interface


Wp-cli is a command line tool to manage WordPress and ease development tasks, an essential part of your toolkit if your work involves WordPress. Get it at [wp-cli.org](http://wp-cli.org/).

During the presentation I showed a live demo of some functionalities, so I added some slides with the examples we saw (white-on-dark slides).
